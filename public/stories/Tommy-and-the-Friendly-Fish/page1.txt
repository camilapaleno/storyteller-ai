Tommy loved the beach. He loved building sandcastles, collecting seashells, and feeling the warm sand between his toes. But there was one thing Tommy was scared of—swimming. The vast, blue ocean seemed too big and too deep. What if there were scary creatures in there? What if he couldn’t float?

One sunny day, as Tommy was playing near the water’s edge, he noticed a shimmering silver fish swimming close to the shore. The fish had big, friendly eyes and a wide smile.

"Hello, little one," the fish said cheerfully. "My name is Finn. Why do you look so sad?"

Tommy hesitated but then sighed. "I’m scared to swim. The ocean is so big and unknown."

Finn nodded understandingly. "I know it looks big, but it’s also full of wonders. Would you like to meet some of my friends? We can help you."

Tommy was nervous but curious. "Alright," he said, his voice barely above a whisper.
