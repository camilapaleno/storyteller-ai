Finn led Tommy into the shallow water and called out, "Coral, Bubbles, come meet Tommy!"

Suddenly, an orange clownfish and a blue tang swam over. Coral, the clownfish, wiggled in excitement. "Hi, Tommy! The ocean isn’t so scary when you have friends."

Bubbles, the blue tang, added, "Swimming is about trust. Trust in yourself and the water."

Tommy watched as the fish twirled and played. With Finn’s gentle encouragement, Tommy took a deep breath and walked deeper into the water. To his surprise, he floated! The water felt cool and refreshing.

"See? You’re doing it!" Coral cheered.

Tommy practiced kicking his legs and moving his arms. The fish swam around him, guiding and cheering him on.

As the sun set, Tommy felt a newfound confidence. "Thank you, Finn, Coral, and Bubbles. I couldn’t have done it without you."

"You were brave, Tommy," Finn said with a sparkle in his eye. "Remember, the ocean is a friend, not a foe."

From that day on, Tommy loved swimming and exploring the underwater world with his new fish friends. The ocean wasn’t scary anymore—it was a place of wonder, adventure, and friendship.
