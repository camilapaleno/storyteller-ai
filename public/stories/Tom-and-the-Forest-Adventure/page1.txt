One bright and sunny morning, Tom decided to explore the forest near his home. He carried his favorite candy, a sweet treat wrapped in shiny red paper. As he wandered deeper into the trees, he marveled at the beauty around him. The forest was alive with the songs of birds and the rustle of leaves.

But then, disaster struck! Tom had been chasing a butterfly and, in his excitement, accidentally dropped his candy. He turned around to pick it up, but it was nowhere to be seen. Tom's eyes filled with tears. How was he going to find his lost candy in this enormous forest?

Just then, Benny the Bunny hopped out from behind a bush. "Why are you sad, Tom?" he asked, his fluffy ears twitching.

"I lost my candy!" Tom sniffled.

"Don't worry, we'll find it together," Benny said cheerfully.
