They decided to start by visiting the park's caretaker, Mr. Grinsley. He might know if someone had lost a puppy. As they walked, they made sure to be extra gentle with their new furry friend.

When they reached Mr. Grinsley's little hut, they saw the walls filled with all sorts of lost and found items. "Hello, Mr. Grinsley! We found this puppy in the bushes. Do you know if anyone's missing him?" Lily asked.

Mr. Grinsley adjusted his glasses and smiled. "Ah, you mean Sir Barksalot! Yes, his owner must be worried sick. I know just where he lives."

Lily and Max followed Mr. Grinsley to a cozy, yellow house where a young girl rushed out to greet them. "Sir Barksalot! I was so worried about you!" she cried, hugging the puppy tightly.

Lily and Max waved goodbye to their new friend, feeling proud and happy that they could help. As they walked back to their favorite spot in the park, they knew their day of adventure would be one they would never forget.
