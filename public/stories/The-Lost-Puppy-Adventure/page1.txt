Lily and Max were best friends who loved to explore the big park near their homes. One sunny afternoon, as they were playing hide and seek, they heard a soft whimper coming from a bush. Curiously, they peeked through the leaves and found a tiny, trembling puppy with big, brown eyes looking up at them with fear.

"Oh no, he looks so scared!" said Lily, her heart melting at the sight. The little puppy wagged its tail slightly, hopeful for some comfort.

Max gently scooped up the puppy. "Don't worry little guy, we'll help you find your way home," he said kindly. The three new friends set off on an adventure to reunite the puppy with its owner.
