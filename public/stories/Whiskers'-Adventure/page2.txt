Whiskers trotted through the lush, green meadows that stretched as far as his eyes could see. The meadows were dotted with colorful flowers and tall, swaying grass. Ahead, he spotted a towering, ancient forest. As he ventured deeper, the sunlight filtered through the thick canopy of leaves, creating a magical, dappled light on the forest floor. There, Whiskers met a wise old owl named Oliver who had soft, brown feathers and big, golden eyes. Oliver told him about a hidden treasure deep within the forest.
