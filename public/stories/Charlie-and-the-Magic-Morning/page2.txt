Outside, Charlie flew above Breezeborough, which looked like a giant patchwork quilt. The houses were painted in bright colors – red, yellow, green, and blue – and each had a quaint garden filled with blooming flowers and singing birds. The town square was a bustling place with cobblestone streets, cheerful market stalls, and a beautiful fountain with sparkling water that danced in the sun.

Charlie flew past Mr. Jenkins' bakery with its inviting aroma of freshly baked bread and Mrs. Potts' flower shop bursting with colors. He even circled the grand oak tree in the park where children often played. The sky was a clear blue canvas, with just a few fluffy clouds making it look like a perfect painting. As Charlie zoomed through the air, he felt the wind gently ruffle his curls and giggled with excitement.
